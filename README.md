# Memo
Write your memos inside this app so you stop forgetting to do your daily routine tasks.
This app was designed simply as a booster to my knowledge of working with SQLite database on Android.

This version is quite simple with just Read & Write methods to add memos to the database. (Although Delete was written in the Dao too, but it isn't used)
 # MVVM Architecture
 The app uses MVVM as described and tought in Google developer codelabs which uses best practices for writing better code.
